# Topic Modelling

The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate topic modelling with [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html)

Run `uv sync` and then `source .venv/bin/activate` to add all necessary packages.

To get the Jupyter notebook in VS Code to use the virtual environment, you must run `code .` in this directory with the virtual environment active.

If you are using a different notebook editor than VS Code, start the editor using the virtual environment's Python instance to activate the kernel with all the packages.
